## General

> I don’t think I’ve ever seen edtech software created in such close dialogue with its intended audience, or so unambiguously created with respect and care for pedagogy.

## Crits

> nodenogg.in proved very effective, we found that the number of students participating increased substantially. It was now the majority of people in the room who would leave feedback, and the nature of the comments left for those presenting was also a lot more liberal.

> Students commented on the fact that they had felt self-conscious during conversations in class, often worrying about being judged on either the questions they’d ask, or the feedback they’d give. Many commented on how nodenogg.in was a great solution.

> Students said that nodenogg.in helped encourage conversation, they often felt more inclined to discuss their projects in the studios after using nodenogg.in.

> With nodenogg.in being anonymous it was seen by students as an ideal method to be a critical friend, they commented how much the feedback would help them in their own project work.

> The feedback in nodenogg.in of course lead to further examination of their own projects and triggering further improvements.

## Curriclum Feedback

> As hand in loomed the students seemed happy and understood what was expected, but as soon as I used nodenogg.in it became clear that was not the case! We cleared up a lot overarching concerns, reduced anxiety, a load of stuff we would never have caught without nodenogg.in.

> we had access to an AGENT prototype feature called SleepeR which enabled you to ingest a small set of reading list texts and used a range of ways to compare nodenogg.in notes to surface extracts from the reading list, this enabled students to engage with the reading lists.
