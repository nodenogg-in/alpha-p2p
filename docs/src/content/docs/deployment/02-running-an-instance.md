title: Running your own instance
---

Although we plan to support a version of nodenogg.in at [https://nodenogg.in](https://nodenogg.in) for the foreseeable future, we want to encourage engaged users to feel a sense of ownership both of their own data and also of nodenogg.in as a part of the digital commons.

A long-term plan is to allow organisations and teams to set up their own nodenogg.in instance. The guide shows the steps involved.
