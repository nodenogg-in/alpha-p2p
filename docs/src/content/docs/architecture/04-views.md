## What is a View?
* A **View** is a template for how people can interact with **Nodes**, **Collections** and **Microcosms**.
* The **Microcosm** provides the backend of data. It's up to the **View** to decide how to present it. 

## Exploring different Views
The research question we are looking to answer is whether students and users might benefit from being able to choose from applying different lenses to collaborative creative work. Digital whiteboards have a tendency to go stale. That's not necessarily a bad thing! They are a snapshot of a point in time, and are a milestone on the way to a wider creative goal. So it's fair that 

However, whiteboard apps can sometimes miss out on the value of semantic data that underpins 

The most prominent view is the 'spatial' view as that's the default and is probably the one that feels most familiar.

However it's important that nodenogg.in feels like **more than just a whiteboard app**.

Whilst we are trying to make our spatial canvas as good as possible, there are other apps that are actually much better at that specific job. For example like [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/). 

[TLDraw](https://www.tldraw.com/), [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) and [Obsidian's Canvas mode](https://obsidian.md/canvas) are also excellent and stand out as fantastic commercial projects that are free to use.
