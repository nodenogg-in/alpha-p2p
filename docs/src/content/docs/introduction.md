title: Introduction
---

[**nodenogg.in**](https://nodenogg.in) is a tool to facilitate creative, collaborative work in educational settings. The concept and its development have been informed by decades of shared experience by practitioner-researchers at [Winchester School of Art/University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/about/faculties-schools-departments/winchester-school-of-art) and elsewhere in the UK.

In 2024 the team behind nodenogg.in, which is led by Dr Adam Procter (head of Games Design & Art at WSA) decided to initiate a new phase of work intended to take nodenogg.in from a research prototype into a reliable tool that could be used widely in learning environments and beyond. The aim is to create a sustainable platform for the project that will allow it to evolve over many years in close conversation with teachers, students and users.
