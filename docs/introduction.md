> This site is part documentation, part working sketchbook for the nodenogg.in project as it evolves.

[**nodenogg.in**](https://nodenogg.in) is a tool that increases participation in feedback and critiques. It is deliberately made to improve student and staff confidence, project outcomes and enhance a community of practice.

nodenogg.in was designed with privacy in mind, to be simple and quick to use.

nodenogg.in supports your education practice by using networked technologies to enhance social learning spaces.

nodenogg.in embraces text only input, coupled with multi views to foster inclusive, fast and intuitive feedback.

nodenogg.in is radical in its simplicity and focus on practice based pedagogy.

nodenogg.in was created to embrace the wonderful slowness of human thought.

nodenogg.in is purposefully small.

> [!NOTE]
> In 2024 the team behind nodenogg.in, led by Dr. Adam Procter (head of [Games Design & Art at WSA](https://winchester.games/courseinfo.html)) decided to initiate a new phase of work intended to take nodenogg.in from a research prototype into a reliable tool that could be used widely in learning environments and beyond. The aim is to create a sustainable platform for the project that will allow it to evolve over many years in close conversation with educators and students.
